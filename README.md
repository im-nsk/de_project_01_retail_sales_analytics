# de_project_01_retail_sales_analytics
As promised, we're kicking off the **Live Data Engineering Project Session**! We‚Äôll cover everything from scratch to advanced, building an end-to-end data pipeline.

Welcome to our first project session! In this project, We create a SQL-based project for a retail company that wants to analyze sales, customer behavior, and inventory data. The project will involve designing a database schema, ingesting data, and performing SQL-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to enable various types of analysis.

#### Steps to Complete the Project:
1. **Database and Table Design**
    - **Create a Star Schema**: Design a data warehouse using a star schema, which is commonly used in analytics.
    - **Fact Table**: Design a `sales` fact table that stores transaction-level data (like `transaction_id`, `product_id`, `customer_id`, `quantity`, `price`, and `timestamp`).
    - **Dimension Tables**: Create dimension tables such as:
        - `products` (columns: `product_id`, `name`, `price`)
        - `customers` (columns: `customer_id`, `name`, `age`, `city`, `state`)
          
2. **Data Ingestion**:
    - Use SQL `INSERT INTO` statements to populate the tables with sample data. You can create a few thousand records for each table to simulate a small dataset. Alternatively, import data from CSV files if you want to work with a larger dataset.
      
3. **Data Transformation (ETL)**
    - **Cleaning and Standardizing Data**: Write SQL scripts to clean and format data, handling duplicates and missing values.
    - **Calculating New Metrics**: For instance, calculate `total_sale_value` as `quantity * price` for each transaction.
    - **Denormalize Data for Analysis**: Using `JOINs`, create views or materialized views that combine data from multiple tables. This could include:
        - A daily sales report view
        - Customer purchase history
        - Product performance analysis
          
4. **Data Aggregation & Analysis Queries**
    - Write SQL queries to generate insights, such as:
        - Total sales per product, category, or brand.
        - Top-performing stores by revenue.
        - Monthly or yearly sales trends.
        - Average customer spend, customer demographics analysis.
        - Inventory insights, e.g., identifying fast-moving products.
        
5. **Optimization**
    - **Indexing**: Add indexes to columns that are frequently used in `JOIN` and `WHERE` clauses to optimize query performance.
    - **Partitioning**: If working with large tables, use partitioning (if your SQL platform supports it) on date-based or category-based columns to speed up queries.
      
6. **Report Creation**
    - Create SQL-based reports using `GROUP BY`, `ROLLUP`, and `CUBE` operations for multidimensional summaries. Example reports:
        - A quarterly revenue breakdown by product category and region.
        - Inventory levels and reorder requirements.
        - Customer segmentation reports.

This project will help you get comfortable with SQL data engineering tasks like data modeling, transformation, aggregation, and optimization. If you‚Äôd like, you can use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other RDBMS for this project. Additionally, if you want to extend it, consider integrating SQL with a tool like Tableau or Power BI for visualization.
